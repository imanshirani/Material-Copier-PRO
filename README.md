A professional and powerful script for 3ds Max that allows you to quickly copy or instance material nodes between different Views in the Slate Material Editor. This tool is designed for organizing complex scenes and managing materials efficiently.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Smart Copy:** Clones material nodes along with all their dependencies and input maps.
* **Instancing:** Creates instanced copies of nodes, so a change to one affects the other.
* **Automatic View Detection:** Automatically detects all your open Views and displays them in a dropdown list.
* **Dockable UI:** The script window is fully dockable within the 3ds Max environment, allowing you to place it alongside other panels.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Open the **Slate Material Editor** (M key).
